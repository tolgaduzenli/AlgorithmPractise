    #Well format Parenthesis
    This question is from Cracking the code interview pdf. I modified that problem a little bit.
    Input can contains any character or it could be empty, null, space etc.
    if first parenthesis is right one like ')', '}', ']', this string doesnt well formatted.
    For extended version of this problem, allowed characters can be different than parenthesis.
    For example; '<' , '>' this characters can be in allowed character. For this situation, only we need to add
    new characters in wellFormatParenthesis map and allowedCharacters list.
